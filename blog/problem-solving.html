      <h1>Problem Solving: Getting unblocked</h1>

          <h2>A time I was blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
          <p>
            Incorrect assumptions about
            <span class="code">array.prototype.map()</span> and
            <span class="code">array.prototype.forEach()</span>
          </p>
          <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
          <p>
            The <span class="code">forEach()</span> method wasn't doing what I
            thought I knew it did; I had given an example of
            <span class="code">map()</span> converting an array of values into
            an array of HTML list items, and then tried to do the same example
            but with <span class="code">forEach()</span> thinking it mutates the
            array, whereas map does not.
          </p>
          <h3>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
          <p>
            I tried a few techniques to work out what was going wrong, firstly
            double checking my code and trying a simple example, and
            console.logging to double check what was happening. That told me
            that it wasn't doing what i thought it should do, so I checked
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach"
            >
              MDN:Array.prototype.forEach()
            </a>
            and
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map"
            >
              MDN:Array.prototype.map() </a
            >, I also googled and found some stack overflow posts discussing the
            differences between map and forEach, and also went back to look at
            some code I had previously written where I knew I had used
            forEach().
          </p>
          <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
          <p>
            I had been using map and forEach with no problems in the past but
            somehow I didn't fully understand them, so this was confusing and
            surprising.
          </p>
          <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
          <p>
            I got a better understanding of how these functions work, but also I
            realised that you can't always rely on things you think you know, I
            had made some incorrect assumptions and when trying to explain one
            of these I found that it was incorrect.

          <h2>A time I elegantly solved a problem:</h2>
          <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
          <p>
            Not sure if this was an elegant solution but I'm happy with the
            final result... I wanted to make my blog list on the front page
            dynamic, so I could filter and group the posts different ways
          </p>
          <h3>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
          <p>
            I had an idea of how I could do it, so first I broke the problem
            down and wrote some high level pseudo code, and worked on each part
            step by step. There was a lot of console logging and using simple
            data which I built up slowly to what was actually required (i.e. the
            full metadata for the posts including post name, url, section name,
            sprint number). There may have a been a bit of googling, and
            probably a lot of talking myself through what it was doing and what
            I needed it to do (i.e. the rubber ducky method).
          </p>
          <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
          <p>
            It took me quite a while to get right, starting with the logic then
            the styling, but I was making good progress throughout and it felt
            good to be using my JS skills to solve a problem, knowing that I had
            even more problem solving tools available if I needed them.
          </p>
          <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
          <p>
            I solidified my understanding of using JS to manipulate the DOM,
            JSON, and also some HTML/CSS, to solve quite a problem that had a
            few elements to it. And reaffirmed that I enjoy problem solving and
            the rewarding feeling of getting things done.

          <h2>Reflecting on the problem solving techniques:</h2>
          <p>
            I'm confident with a wide array of problem-solving techniques and
            processes, ranging from effective pseudocode planning to reading
            documentation and online resources to seeking guidance from peers
            and coaches. This confidence allows me to approach challenges with
            assurance and adaptability, knowing that I can leverage these tools
            effectively to find solutions and continuously improve my approach.
