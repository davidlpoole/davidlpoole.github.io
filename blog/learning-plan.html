      <h1>My Dev Academy Learning Plan</h1>

          <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            My plan initially is to get some experience as a junior developer
            after the bootcamp, if I enjoy that then I'd like to progress to
            intermediate/senior, or find a way to combine software development
            with my previous experience in business intelligence and business
            analysis.

          <h3>
            A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
            learning
          </h3>
          <p>
            I enjoy learning things and hours can disappear when I get engrossed
            in something and go down different rabbit holes, so something that I
            am working on and I think is improving with the new found use of
            Toggl/Pomodoro, is to stay focussed on what's important and not to
            go too far off topic. I am also embracing the philosophy of just in
            time learning.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy
          </h3>
          <p>
            I've spent the last year solo travelling and getting out of my
            comfort zone, and it's something I would like to continue developing
            - to speak up and participate actively, and to develop my leadership
            skills.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>
            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
          </h3>
          <p>
            I plan to commit my time 100% to the course. From what I've seen up
            until now it seems that everyone is really supportive of eachother
            and I hope that if anyone else is struggling with something that
            I'll be able to help, and hopefully vice versa.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>
            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
          </h3>
          <p>
            I'm usually pretty good at problem solving, finding answers and
            working things out, but I'm not afraid to ask for help if something
            is taking too long to figure out, so I plan to reach out to other
            students and facilitators when required.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
          <p>
            I'm expecting the facilitation team to be our guides, providing
            clear learning structures, and helping us find our way.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
            committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
            commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
          </h3>
          <p>Nothing planned, 100% all in.</p>
