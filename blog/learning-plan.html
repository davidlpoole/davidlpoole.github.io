            <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>
              My plan initially is to get some experience as a junior developer
              after the bootcamp, if I enjoy that then I'd like to progress to
              intermediate/senior, or potentially use my previous experience in
              business intelligence and business analysis to pivot to a role
              which utilises aspects of all of these skills.

              A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
              learning
            </h3>
            <p>
              I enjoy learning things and hours can disappear when I get
              engrossed in something and go down different rabbit holes, so
              something that I am working on and I think is improving with the
              new found use of Toggl/Pomodoro, is to stay focussed on what's
              important and not to go too far off topic. I am also embracing the
              philosophy of just in time learning.

              What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to
              see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy
            </h3>
            <p>
              I've spent the last year solo travelling and getting out of my
              comfort zone, and it's something I would like to continue
              developing - to speak up and particpate actively, and to take a
              leadership role rather than taking a back seat.
            </p>

            <h3>
              A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
              programme.
            </h3>
            <p>
              I plan to commit my time 100% to the course, the great thing about
              being single is I can focus 100% on whatever I want, haha. From
              what I've seen up until now it seems that everyone is really
              supportive of eachother and I hope that if anyone else is
              struggling with something that I'll be able to help, and hopefully
              vice versa.
            </p>

            <h3>
              A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
              way
            </h3>
            <p>
              I'm not afraid to ask for help if I need it - if I googling
              doesn't solve something I'd ask in the Discord to either get help
              from other students or from the facilitors.

            <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
            <p>
              I guess just support and provision of the learning structure and
              goals etc, provide materials where available or I can go and look
              things up myself.

              Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
              committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
              commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these
              in.
