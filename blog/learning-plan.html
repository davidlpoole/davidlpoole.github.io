      <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            My goal is to work in a tech company where I can contribute to
            creating innovative applications and platforms, drawing on my
            previous experience in business analysis, supply chain management
            and IT training.. I envision myself developing user-friendly
            products that simplify complex tasks and enhance user experiences.

          <h3>
            What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
            Bootcamp?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A couple of my strengths are my attention to detail and the pride I
            take in my work. This ensures a high standard of output; however, it
            can also be a limitation as it may lead me to over-complicate tasks
            and spend excessive time perfecting them. To mitigate this, I intend
            to set clear time benchmarks for each task, reminding myself that
            achieving a good result within a reasonable timeframe is crucial.
            It's about finding a balance between maintaining quality and
            avoiding unnecessary perfectionism.

            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
            will be?
          </h3>
          <p>
            One of the main challenges I anticipate during Bootcamp is
            maintaining a healthy work-life balance while fully immersing myself
            in the program. Having the right balance between dedicating ample
            time to learning and ensuring personal well-being is a crucial
            aspect for me. It's important to prioritize self-care, manage time
            effectively, and stay organized to tackle the challenge
            successfully.

            What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I aspire to enhance my communication and teamwork skills during my
            time at Dev Academy. Effective communication and the ability to work
            collaboratively within a team are vital in the tech industry. I also
            aim to improve my self-awareness, enabling me to adapt and grow both
            personally and professionally.

          <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
          <p>
            I expect the Bootcamp team to provide a supportive and motivating
            learning environment. Clear communication, guidance, and
            constructive feedback will be crucial for my growth during Bootcamp.
            I hope for a collaborative atmosphere where everyone can learn from
            each other.

        <li>
          <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
          <p>
            During Bootcamp, I will proactively seek help when needed, utilizing
            available resources such as mentors, fellow students, and online
            documentation. I commit to managing my workload by setting
            achievable daily goals, regularly reviewing my progress, and
            adjusting my plan as necessary. Additionally, I'll actively engage
            in group activities, contribute my ideas, and ensure a respectful
            and inclusive interaction with peers and facilitators.

        <li>
          <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            My plan initially is to get some experience as a junior developer
            after the bootcamp, if I enjoy that then I'd like to progress to
            intermediate/senior, or find a way to combine software development
            with my previous experience in business intelligence and business
            analysis.

            A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
            learning
          </h3>
          <p>
            I enjoy learning things and hours can disappear when I get engrossed
            in something and go down different rabbit holes, so something that I
            am working on and I think is improving with the new found use of
            Toggl/Pomodoro, is to stay focussed on what's important and not to
            go too far off topic. I am also embracing the philosophy of just in
            time learning.

          <h3>
            What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy
          </h3>
          <p>
            I've spent the last year solo traveling and getting out of my
            comfort zone, and it's something I would like to continue developing
            - to speak up and participate actively, and to develop my leadership
            skills.

          <h3>
            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
          </h3>
          <p>
            I plan to commit my time 100% to the course. From what I've seen up
            until now it seems that everyone is really supportive of each other
            and I hope that if anyone else is struggling with something that
            I'll be able to help, and hopefully vice versa.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>
            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
          </h3>
          <p>
            I'm usually pretty good at problem solving, finding answers and
            working things out, but I'm not afraid to ask for help if something
            is taking too long to figure out, so I plan to reach out to other
            students and facilitators when required.
          </p>

          <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
          <p>
            I'm expecting the facilitation team to be our guides, providing
            clear learning structures, and helping us find our way.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
            committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
            commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
