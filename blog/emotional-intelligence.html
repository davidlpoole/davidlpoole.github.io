          <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
          <p>
            Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is the ability to handle emotions, of
            both yourself and others. It's like being in tune with your own
            feelings, keeping them in check when necessary, staying motivated,
            getting what's going on in other people's heads, and handling social
            stuff well.

          <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
          <p>
            IQ is book smarts, stuff like math, logic, and puzzles. EQ, on the
            other hand, is street smarts, all about your emotional and social
            skills - how well you understand and handle your own feelings and
            those of others. While IQ tends to remain relatively stable as you
            get older, EQ can be developed and refined, making it a vital
            contributor to overall success, as it empowers individuals to
            navigate emotions, collaborate effectively, and lead fulfilling
            lives.

          <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
          <p>
            EQ is important for career growth and learning because it enhances
            your interpersonal skills, emotional resilience, adaptability, and
            overall effectiveness in the workplace. It empowers you to navigate
            complex social and emotional dynamics, which are inherent in
            professional settings, and positions you for success and personal
            development.
