      <h1>My Identity, Values, and Strengths</h1>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>
            Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
            how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
            decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
          </h3>
          <p>
            AI is all the rage at the moment and there's been talk about people
            using ChatGPT to cheat in school. Now finding myself studying in a
            more formal setting, it is interesting to think about where the
            ethical line is when using AI tools for study. Given my values of
            honesty and integrity I don't think it would be ethical to use AI
            tools to skip the process of critical thinking, if not only because
            I am here to learn, and thinking/reflecting is a major part of the
            laerning process, but I also want to be able to honestly say all the
            work is my own and be proud of that fact.

        <li>
          <h3>
            Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
            your values and identity.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Growing up in the UK surrounded by a supportive community of people,
            I think I gained the values of honesty, integrity and hard work. And
            I've been lucky to be able to travel a lot and experience different
            cultures, and living in New Zealand for the last 10 years, I've
            noticed similar values to the UK but with more emphasis on health
            and wellbeing and love of the natural environment.
          </p>

        <li>
          <h3>
            Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
            learning journey.
          </h3>
          <p>
            I am a problem solver and critical thinker by nature, I also don't
            like to fail at anything (not sure what that's called) but it means
            I am persistent at learning new things and getting stuff to work.
            These strengths should help me in the face of any challenges I come
            up against, and also because I enjoy solving problems, I like to
            help other people who may be stuck too.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>
            Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
            development. How might these affect your learning journey?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Something I'm working on is my self confidence and assertiveness,
            and over-thinking things - I need to try my best to participate
            actively because that's the best way to learn. I've been working on
            these things over the last year or so since I left my last job, and
            through solo travelling have gained more self confidence.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>
            Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
            others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
            tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
            what other strategies you would try now and why.
          </h3>
          <p>
            As a business analyst there would be times during stakeholder
            engagement where I'd find people were resistant to providing
            information about a process because they saw my role as trying to
            replace them with a new computer system. I empathise and reassure
            them that often we were just improving processes and it would make
            their job easier and give them more time to do something else - and
            if they had any ideas as to what that could look like I would be
            sure to report on that.
