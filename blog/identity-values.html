            Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
            how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
            decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Given the recent AI hype, I've found myself faced with an ethical
            dilemma: should I use ChatGPT to make my school life easier?
            Reflecting on it, my values of honesty and integrity came into play.
            I realized that using AI as a shortcut in my studies would undermine
            the whole point of learning. Learning isn't just about gaining
            knowledge; it's about the journey of growing intellectually.
            Skipping the critical thinking part with AI wouldn't be fair to
            myself, and it wouldn't align with my values. Plus, I've always
            believed in taking pride in my work. There's something immensely
            satisfying about knowing that my academic achievements are a result
            of my own effort and understanding. Relying on AI would cheapen that
            sense of accomplishment. So, I've made the ethical decision to stick
            to the old-fashioned way of studying, even though AI is tempting. It
            allows me to truly engage with my studies, develop my critical
            thinking skills, and, most importantly, maintain my integrity.

            Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced

          </h3>
          <p>
            Growing up in the UK, I was surrounded by a supportive community
            that instilled in me the values of honesty, integrity, and hard
            work. During my travels since leaving the UK, living in New Zealand
            for the past 10 years, I've noticed some similarities and
            differences. In both places, there's a strong emphasis on values
            like honesty and integrity. However, New Zealanders seem to
            prioritize health, wellbeing, and a deep love for the natural
            environment even more. So, my background in the UK laid the
            foundation for my values, while New Zealand has deepened my
            appreciation for health, nature, and a well-rounded life.

            Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
            learning journey.
          </h3>
          <p>
            My strengths include being a natural problem solver and critical
            thinker. I'm also quite persistent, which drives me to overcome
            challenges and learn new things effectively. Additionally, I enjoy
            assisting others who may be facing similar obstacles. These
            qualities will support me in my learning journey by enabling me to
            tackle challenges head-on and contribute positively to the learning
            community.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Over the last 12 months I've been working on addressing my tendency
            to overthink, which can hinder decision-making and delay my academic
            and career progress. I'm also working on boosting my
            self-confidence, as it impacts active participation, effective
            communication, and is essential when it comes to networking and
            career development.

            Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
            others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
            tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
            what other strategies you would try now and why.
          </h3>
          <p>
            In my previous role as a business analyst, I often faced resistance
            from stakeholders who feared that my work would replace their
            processes with computer systems. To address this, I used empathy and
            reassurance, emphasizing process enhancement rather than replacement
            and encouraging their input. While these strategies generally eased
            tensions and promoted collaboration, I now realize that involving
            stakeholders from the project's start would have been even more
            effective in reducing initial resistance and fostering collaboration
            sooner.
