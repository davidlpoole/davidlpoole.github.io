        <em>
          TLDR: padding is the spacing between the actual content and the
          border, and margin is the space outside the border.

      <h3>06 September 2023</h3>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to crafting visually appealing web pages using HTML and
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), every element on the page, be it a div or
        an img, is essentially a box. These boxes play a pivotal role in
        determining how content is laid out and spaced on your website. To
        understand and manipulate these boxes effectively, it's essential to
        grasp the concepts of content, margin, border, and padding within the
        CSS box model.
      </p>
      <h3>Exploring the CSS Box Model</h3>
      <p>
        To visualize the CSS box model in action, you can utilize browser
        developer tools like Chrome's Inspector. By pressing
        <span class="code">F12</span> or
        <span class="code">cmd + opt + i</span> (on Mac) and navigating to the
        Inspector tab, you'll be able to see how elements are structured on the
        page. In the Inspector, selecting an element on the left updates the
        'Box Model' representation on the right, providing a visual breakdown of
        its dimensions.
      </p>
      <img
        class="img-center"
        src="/images/box-model-large.png"
        alt="screenshot of the box model display
        from DevTools"
      />
      <h3>The CSS box model consists of four critical dimensions</h3>
      <p>
        Content:<br />The content refers to the actual element content, such as
        text or images. The dimensions of this content, including height and
        width, are integral to how the element is displayed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Padding, Border, and Margin:<br />
        These three sections are defined in CSS by specifying values for the
        top, right, bottom, and left dimensions individually. For instance, you
        can set them individually like so:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="code">padding-top: 5px;</li>
        <li class="code">border-bottom: 1px;</li>
        <li class="code">padding-left: 20px;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Alternatively, shorthand clockwise notation can be used by referencing
        just one value for padding, border, or margin, following the order of
        top, right, bottom, and left:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="code">margin: 10px 20px 30px 20px;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In this example, it would create a 10px space at the top of the element,
        20px to the right, 30px at the bottom, and 20px on the left.
      </p>
      <h3>Border</h3>
      <p>
        After the content, the border is often the most visible part of the box
        model. Adding borders around elements is a common practice, and you can
        control its thickness, style, and color in your CSS. A concise way to
        set the border is by using shorthand notation like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="code">border: solid 1px black;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This code snippet would produce a single-pixel black border around the
        element's content.
      </p>
      <h3>Deciphering Margin and Padding</h3>
      <p>
        Margin and padding can sometimes be confusing, as they appear to serve
        similar purposes, especially when there is no visible border. Here's a
        straightforward distinction:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Padding: This is the space between the content and the border. It
          defines the internal spacing within the element.
        </li>
        <li>
          Margin: Margin, on the other hand, represents the outermost space
          outside the border. Think of it as the page margin in a book or the
          white space surrounding your web page.
        </li>
      </ul>
