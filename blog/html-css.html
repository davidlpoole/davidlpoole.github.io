        TLDR: padding is the spacing between the actual content and the border,
        and margin is the space outside the border

        <h2>Intro to the CSS box model</h2>
        <p>
          When designing a web page using HTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets),
          every element placed on the page (such as a `div` or `img`) are
          represented as a box.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can be seen by opening up the chrome developer tools while on a
          web page (`command + opt + i` on a mac), and navigating to the
          Inspector tab of the dev tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Selecting an element in the Inspector on the left of the devtools will
          update the 'Box Model' image on the right hand side under 'Layout'.
        </p>
        <img
          class="img-center"
          src="/images/box-model-large.png"
          alt="screenshot of the box model display
        from DevTools"
        />
        <p>
          From the Box Model display we can see that there are 4 different
          dimensions that determine how an element is displayed, and these are
          the size of the content, padding, border and margin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Double-clicking and editing any of the numbers in the DevTools box
          model will update the element live on the screen and is an easy way to
          quickly see what difference a change to the CSS would make.
        </p>
        <h2>The difference between content, margin, border and padding</h2>
        <h3>Content</h3>
        <p>
          The content is the actual content of the element, like text or images
          - this content will determine the dimensions in addition to the height
          and width CSS properties.
        </p>
        <h3>Margin, Border, and Padding</h3>
        <p>
          The other three sections are defined in the CSS by a top, right,
          bottom, left dimension.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might set these on individual sides like this:<br />
          padding-top: 5px; <br />
          border-bottom: 1px; <br />
          padding-left: 20px;
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also use shorthand clockwise notation by referencing just
          either padding, border or padding as follows using the order of top,
          right, bottom, left: <br />
          margin: 10px 20px 30px 20px; <br />
          this would give a 10px spacing at the top of the element, 20px to the
          right, 30px underneath, and 20px on the left.
        </p>
        <h3>Border</h3>
        <p>
          After the actual content, the border is the next most obvious part of
          the model, as it is quite common to add a border around an element and
          the thickness can be set, for example it might be 1px thick. When
          setting the border in the CSS style, the easiest way is to use the
          shorthand version which takes parameters of style, thickness and
          colour as so: <br />
          border: solid 1px black;<br />
          which would give a single pixel black border around the content.
        </p>
        <h3>Margin and Padding</h3>
        <p>
          Then we have the less obvious (to me) sections, I think I get confused
          because often there is no visible border, therefore padding and margin
          appear to do the same thing.
        </p>
        <p>Padding is the space between the content and the border.</p>
        <p>
          Margin is the outermost space outside of the border, I usually
          remember this by thinking it's like the margin on a piece of paper.
