      <h2>What is Te Whare Tapa whā?</h2>
      <p>
        Te Whare Tapa Whā is a Māori model of wellbeing, likened to a four-sided
        house, presenting four interconnected dimensions: physical health (Taha
        Tinana), spiritual wellbeing (Taha Wairua), family connections (Taha
        Whānau), and mental and emotional wellness (Taha Hinengaro), plus the
        Whenua (land) which forms the foundation for the four dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The model emphasizes the necessity of balance and integration of these
        dimensions for overall health. It's a culturally grounded approach to
        understanding health within the Māori context, offering a holistic
        perspective essential for addressing health issues in the Māori
        community and beyond.
