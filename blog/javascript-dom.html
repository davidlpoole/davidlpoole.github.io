      <h1>What is JavaScript and the DOM?</h1>
      <p>
        <em>
          TL;DR: JavaScript is a programming language used for web development,
          enabling interactivity and dynamic content on websites. The DOM
          (Document Object Model) is a representation of a webpage's structure
          in a tree-like format, manipulated by JavaScript to update and modify
          webpage content dynamically.

      <h2>How does JavaScript relate to HTML and CSS?</h2>
      <p>Building a website with HTML/CSS/JS is like constructing a building</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML is the foundation and structure.</li>
        <li>CSS is the aesthetics and design.</li>
        <li>
          JavaScript is the interactive and functional components that make your
          building (or website) not just visually pleasing but also practical
          and engaging.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What are functions, control flow and loops?</h2>
      <b>Functions:</b> In JavaScript, functions are like predefined sets of
      instructions that can be reused to perform a specific task or operation.
      They are helpful because they promote code reusability, organization, and
      modularity. Each step in making a pizza is like a function, for example
      the first step preparing dough is not specific to pizza and can be used in
      other recipes such as making donuts or bagettes.

      <p>
        <b>Control Flow</b>: Control flow is like the step by step instructions
        you follow when making a pizza. It's the order in which you do things to
        get something done:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare Dough</li>
        <li>Add Sauce</li>
        <li>Add Cheese</li>
        <p>
          <b>Loops:</b> At this point we want to start adding a heap of toppings
          and because this is a repetitive procedure, we can do it using a loop,
          repeating the next steps (a, b, c) until we've got all the toppings we
          want.
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Choose a Topping</li>
          <li>Prepare the Topping</li>
          <li>Add the Topping</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Now that we have added all the toppings, the control flow continues
          with the rest of the process:
        </p>
        <li>Bake</li>
        <li>Slice</li>
        <li>Serve</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What is the DOM (Document Object Model)?</h2>
      <p>
        The DOM is an interface for web documents. It represents the web page as
        a tree of objects, where each part of the web page (like HTML elements,
        attributes, and text) is represented as a node in this tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DOM allows you to interact with web pages dynamically using
        JavaScript, allowing you to access, and change the content, structure,
        and style of a web page.
      </p>
      <p>
        The code snippet below shows a simple example of using JavaScript to
        manipulate the DOM.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
01  &lt;html&gt;
02    &lt;body&gt;
03      &lt;p id=&quot;myText&quot;&gt;Click the button to change this text!&lt;/p&gt;
04      &lt;button onclick=&quot;changeText()&quot;&gt;Change Text&lt;/button&gt;
05
06      &lt;script&gt;
07          function changeText() {
08              const element = document.getElementById('myText');
09              element.innerHTML = 'Text has been changed!';
10          }
11      &lt;/script&gt;
12    &lt;/body&gt;
13  &lt;/html&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Line 03: is a tag with the id <span class="code">myText</span> with
          some text we want to change.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line 04: Adds a button that will run the
          <span class="code">changeText()</span> function when clicked.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line 08: Searches the DOM for an element that has id
          <span class="code">myText</span> and saves a pointer variable.
        </li>
        <li>Line 09: Uses the elements innerHTML method to edit the text.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        What's the difference between accessing data in arrays and objects in
        JS?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Arrays and objects are data structures that have some similarities in
        that they can hold collections of data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrays are good for storing lists of similar items because you can
        easily sort or filter them, whereas objects are better for storing mixed
        data that can have named properties, such as storing details about a
        person (name, address, phone number, etc), and then accessing individual
        values using the key without having to loop through every bit of data to
        find what you want.
