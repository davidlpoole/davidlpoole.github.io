          <h2>
            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
            ego due to the core learning?
          </h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              I find genuine satisfaction in working with and assisting others -
              helping to solve a problem, offering guidance, or providing
              support, that sense of satisfaction encourages me to keep helping
              and being a valuable resource for those around me.
            </li>
            <li>
              Taking pride in my work motivates me to ensure that it meets high
              standards and reflects the dedication and effort I put into it.
              This mindset pushes me to consistently deliver my best work.
            </li>
            <li>
              I have a strong sense of attention to detail which ensures that
              the final output is polished and accurate, ensuring I meet the
              specific requirements and exceed expectations where possible.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>
            What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
            and programming?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Values guide decisions and define professional identity, empathy
            enables better team collaboration and user focussed solutions, and
            self-awareness enables effective learning and personal growth.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
          <p>
            I was surprised by the strong focus on personal growth and
            self-awareness throughout the Foundations Core Skills program. It
            was eye-opening to learn that tech employers prioritize exceptional
            human qualities and cultural fit, shifting my perspective on what
            makes a valuable candidate. Additionally, researching
            neuroplasticity, growth mindsets, and honing effective communication
            skills like active listening highlighted the vital role of mindset
            and interpersonal abilities in the tech industry. The holistic
            approach to learning and problem-solving, surpassed my expectations,
            emphasizing the need to be a well-rounded professional beyond just
            technical competence.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
          <p>
            Introspection was challenging for me at first; delving into my
            emotions and interpreting them into something I could write down is
            something I've always struggled with, but I feel like I have got
            much better and less self conscious with sharing those feelings.
            Establishing consistent habits like daily meditation and
            self-reflection presented their own set of difficulties; initially,
            finding the time and committing to these practices was a struggle,
            but with perseverance and determination, I successfully managed to
            make them a part of my routine, and I've noticed the benefits.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
            focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The core learning promotes holistic skill development by focussing
            on problem-solving, effective communication, and teamwork, preparing
            students not just to be coders but also to be adaptable
            professionals which is essential in such a fast changing industry.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
            waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice
            programming instead? Justify your answer.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Dedicating time to the core/soft skills has been really useful and
            is essential because they are the building blocks of effective
            collaboration and communication. Skills like adaptability, empathy,
            and teamwork create a positive work environment and enhance
            employability, job satisfaction, and leadership potential, which
            will all be crucial in my future career progression.
